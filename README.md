# MNCS Player Stats Analysis Project

TODO: Write the purpose

## Setup

The project is built on Python 3.10. Install that. I'm running Windows but Mac should be fine as well. I'd recommend using git bash for Windows.

Run this to create a virtual environment with 3.10 and activate it

```bash
python3.10 -m venv env
source env/Scripts/activate
```

Install requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

I'd recommend using VS Code and Jupyer Notebooks with the Jupyter extension.
